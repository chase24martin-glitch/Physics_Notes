This is the intermediate stage to our building process. Geometry is both the canvas upon which we create and the paint with which we form our art. Physics will transform from a boring subject
in school to a tapestry of interacting characters, each with a personality of their own. It will become a way to express yourself every bit as much as a master musician picking up an instrument
to create a new song.
